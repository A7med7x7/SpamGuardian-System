# SpamGuardian-System

## Overview
The SpamGuardian-System project is a simple web application that serves as an introduction to spam classification and RESTful API development. Despite having experience with various machine learning models and applications, this project explores a fundamental task—building a spam classifier. This serves as a great starting point for learning how to work with Flask, rendering templates, and handling model deployment.

## Features
- **Spam Classifier**: A basic spam classification model that categorizes email content as spam or ham.
- **Web Application**: Implemented using Flask, with routes for interacting with the classifier.
- **Model Management**: Includes functionality to save and load machine learning models.
- **User Interface**: HTML and CSS-based interface for user interactions.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: You can clone the repository using the HTTPS link or fork it and use GitHub Codespaces for development.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/A7med7x7/SpamGuardian-System.git
   ```

2. **Directory Structure**: Ensure your project directory follows this structure:

   ```
   /SpamGuardian-System/
   ├── app.py                     # Flask application
   ├── models/                    # Machine learning models
   ├── static/                    # Static files (CSS, JS, images)
   │   └── styles.css             # CSS file
   ├── templates/                 # HTML templates
   │   └── index.html             # HTML file
   ```

3. **Update Paths**: Modify any directory paths in the code to match your local setup.

4. **Install Dependencies**: Use a `requirements.txt` file to manage and install Python dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
